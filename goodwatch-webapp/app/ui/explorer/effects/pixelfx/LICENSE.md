# pixelfx (vendored for the explorer map)

Copied from https://github.com/patch-gg/pixelfx at a84159688af3ca37a4be05a0d422b94451b2e24e. `core/` is the library's
core, unchanged except `core/index.js` (trimmed), `core/index.d.ts` (types), `core/fx.js` (an `alpha` option that fades a
whole effect) and `core/painter.js` (`glowRing` scans only the ring's band inside the frame). `fx/cinema/` holds effects written for GoodWatch's
map with the library's tools.
